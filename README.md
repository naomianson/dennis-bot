# dennis-bot v0.1.0
A chaotic beginner-friendly Python bot with feelings, too many opinions and an unhealthy amount of confidence for someone who is one (1) year old.

This project is a learning space for Pythin fundamentals, structure and versioning.

Current features:
- Asks for your name, age, favourite colour and location.
- Reacts with emotion to your age.
- Has opinions on colours and cities.
- He will judge you.
- Hidden lore sprinkled in. It's your job to find it.

Planed features (v0.2+/ Coming soon):
- Birthday mechanic (don’t tell him about versioning he is innocent)
- Lore expansion (will grow with each release)
- Easter eggs tied to dates, colours and secret inputs.
- Surprises and chaos

This is a learning project. Expect chaos.
